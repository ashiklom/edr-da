Dear Dr. Christoph MÃ¼ller,

Thank you for your prompt review of our GMD submission!
We have addressed your comments as follows:

> In GMD, models need to be named with a version number in the title of the article.
> Even though you have filed this manuscript as a "Methods for assessments of models" paper (I choice I generally agree with), the methods description, results and interpretation very much focus on your test case: ED2 and PROSPECT5. I would thus suggest to name these in the title, e.g. as "Cutting out the middleman: Calibrating and validating a dynamic
> vegetation model (ED2-PROSPECT5) using remotely sensed surface reflectance".

We have revised the title per your suggestion: "...dynamic vegetation model (ED2-PROSPECT5) using remotely sensed...".

> Is the data/source code archive of permanent nature?

Yes, the Open Science Framework (OSF) is a permanent archive.
According to their website, OSF has a preservation fund that ensures that, if they cease operation, existing projects will continue to be stored for 50+ years.[^1]
Furthermore, once this manuscript is accepted, we will convert our current OSF project (which is currently mutable) to a _registration_, which cannot be altered or deleted.[^2]
However, if you feel these terms are unacceptable, we are happy to consider alternative data and software storage repositories.

Please let us know if any further revisions are required before this manuscript is submitted for review.
