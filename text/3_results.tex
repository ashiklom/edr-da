    Marginal prior (pre-calibration; grey) and posterior (post-calibration; black) distributions of PFT-specific parameters
    related to leaf biochemistry and canopy structure.
    Distributions are shown as violin plots (rotated and mirrored kernel density plots).
    PFTs are abbreviated as follows:
    EH:\@Early Hardwood;
    MH:\@North Mid Hardwood;
    LH:\@Late Hardwood;
    NP:\@Northern Pine;
    LC:\@Late conifer.
    Leaf and wood biomass allometry panels are clipped at 0.2 to facilitate differentiation of posterior distributions.

Model calibration improved the precision of most PFT-specific parameter estimates, including estimates of leaf parameters whose prior distributions were already independently constrained by an earlier analysis (Figure~\ref{fig:posterior-pft}).
Across all PFT-specific parameters, the posterior 95\% credible interval (CI) was, on average, 9\% the size of the prior credible interval.
The most constrained parameters on average were EDR canopy structure parameters---namely the wood biomass allometry (<1\% of prior CI), wood biomass allometry (1\%), specific leaf area (7\%), leaf orientation factor (8\%), and clumping factor (9\%)---
while the least constrained parameters on average were the PROSPECT parameters---namely, effective number of leaf layers (17\%), total carotenoid content (16\%), dry matter content (12\%), total chlorophyll content (12\%), and leaf water content (10\%).
By PFT, the largest relative constraint was for early hardwood (5\%) and the smallest relative constraint was for late hardwood (14\% of prior CI).

For leaf traits, PFT rankings of the posterior estimates largely followed the relative positions of the priors, though there were a few exceptions.
In both the prior and posterior, the estimated effective number of leaf mesophyll layers (a.k.a., PROSPECT \emph{N} parameter) was higher for needleleaved than broadleaved PFTs, with the highest value for northern pine and the lowest value for mid hardwood.
The exact opposite was true of specific leaf area (SLA), except that late conifer had a lower posterior SLA than northern pine despite a very similar prior.
Estimated total chlorophyll contents (\emph{Cab}) were similarly high for all hardwood PFTs in both the prior and posterior,
but posterior estimates for late conifer and northern pine were significantly lower.
Posterior estimates of total carotenoid contents (\emph{Car}) were similar across all PFTs except mid hardwood, which had a significantly higher value (despite a prior that was similar for all hardwood PFTs).
Posterior estimates of leaf water content (\emph{Cw}) were lowest for early hardwood and northern pine, higher for mid- and late hardwood, and highest for late conifer; these differences were despite strongly overlapping priors across all PFTs.
Similarly, posterior estimates of leaf dry matter content (\emph{Cm}) were lowest for mid- and late hardwood, higher for early hardwood and northern pine, and highest for late conifer, again despite a strongly overlapping prior across all PFTs.

Compared to leaf traits, canopy structural traits had less informative (and PFT-agnostic) priors, and the posterior distributions exhibited some differences across PFTs.
Posterior leaf biomass allometry ($\bbbl$) estimates were lowest in northern pine and early hardwood, higher for late conifer, and highest for mid- and late hardwood.
Posterior wood biomass allometry ($\bbbw$) estimates were lowest for early hardwood and late conifer, slightly higher in mid- and late hardwood, and highest for northern pine.
Posterior canopy clumping factor ($q$) estimates were clustered at its upper limit of 1 (i.e., exhibited ``edge-hitting behavior'') for early and mid hardwood and northern pine, but were lower for late hardwood and lowest for late conifer.
Finally, the calibration was able to constrain site-specific soil optical properties across all sites (Figure~\ref{fig:posterior-soil}).

The accuracy and precision of EDR simulated spectra relative to AVIRIS observations varied across sites (Figures~\ref{fig:spec-error-aggregate},~\ref{fig:bias-boxplot-pft},~\ref{fig:spec-error-all}, and~\ref{fig:spec-error-allsites}).
On average, EDR tended to accurately (within 0.01) reproduce reflectance in the 400--750 \unit{nm} range, underpredict AVIRIS reflectance by \~0.03 in the 750--1100 \unit{nm} range, and overpredict AVIRIS reflectance by \~0.04 in the 1100--1300 \unit{nm} range.
However, only the latter behavior was mostly consistent across site; below 1100 \unit{nm}, sites of any dominant PFT could have low, accurate, or high estimates relative to AVIRIS.\@
The EDR posterior predictive interval overlapped AVIRIS observations in all but a few individual cases (Figure~\ref{fig:spec-error-allsites}), suggesting that our estimates of model uncertainty are realistic.
The only consistent biases (expressed as interquartile range in bias not overlapping zero) we observed with respect to PFT were overestimates of reflectance in the 400--750 \unit{nm} range for northern pine and underestimates of reflectance in the 750--1100 \unit{nm} range for mid hardwood;
otherwise, we did not observe any consistent patterns in mismatch between AVIRIS observed and EDR predicted reflectance with respect to tree size, stem density, or composition (Figures~\ref{fig:bias-boxplot-pft} and~\ref{fig:bias-density-pft}--\ref{fig:tree-sites-LC}).

Leaf area index predicted from calibrated EDR parameters captured 56\% of the variability in the observations (Figure~\ref{fig:lai-pred-obs}).
The observed vs.\ predicted line had a slope of 0.42 and an intercept of 2.82, indicating that EDR calibration underpredicted true LAI on average but exaggerated across-site LAI variability.
In general, EDR tended to underpredict LAI at high-density sites with low mean DBH and overpredict at low-density sites with high mean DBH (Figures~\ref{fig:lai-bias-dbh-bypft} and~\ref{fig:lai-bias-dens-bypft}).
The trend with mean DBH was generally true across all PFTs but was most pronounced for early hardwood- and late conifer-dominated sites.
The trend with stand density was most pronounced for late conifer-dominated sites, though that may be because these sites covered the widest range in stand density.

  \caption{\label{fig:edr-sail-comparison-czen}\
    Comparison of EDR and PRO4SAIL (labelled as ``SAIL'' for conciseness) predictions of reflectance for identical, single-cohort canopies as a function of solar zenith angle ($\theta_{s}$).
    These simulations use identical PROSPECT and canopy structure parameters, a nadir-viewing sensor, and LAI of 3.
    For EDR, we use a single cohort with LAI of 3 prescribed directly.\@
    ``SAIL:\@HR'' is the ``hemispherical reflectance'' (``blue-sky albedo''), calculated (as in EDR) as the average of directional-hemispherical (DHR) and bi-hemispherical (BHR) reflectance streams weighted by the direct sky fraction (0.9; same value used for EDR).
    Similarly, ``SAIL:\@DR'' is the ``directional reflectance'', calculated analogously from the bi-directional (BDR) and hemispherical-directional (HDR) reflectance streams.
    Individual SAIL fluxes are shown with dotted lines.
  }
\end{figure}

For identical canopies, EDR consistently predicted lower hemispherical reflectance than PRO4SAIL (Figure~\ref{fig:edr-sail-comparison-czen}).
This difference was most pronounced when the sun was directly overhead ($\theta_{s} = 0\degree$; $\cos(\theta_{s}) = 1$) and declined with increasing solar zenith angle.
For solar zenith angles typical of our study, ($\theta_{s} \approx 30\degree$; $\cos(\theta_{s}) = 0.85$) EDR hemispherical reflectance predictions were very close to PRO4SAIL directional reflectance predictions over a wide range of LAI values (Figure~\ref{fig:edr-sail-comparison-lai}).
