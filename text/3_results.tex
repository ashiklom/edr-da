    Marginal prior (pre-calibration; grey) and posterior (post-calibration; black) distributions of PFT-specific parameters
    related to leaf biochemistry and canopy structure.
    Distributions are shown as violin plots (rotated and mirrored kernel density plots).
    PFTs are abbreviated as follows:
    EH:\@Early Hardwood;
    MH:\@North Mid Hardwood;
    LH:\@Late Hardwood;
    NP:\@Northern Pine;
    LC:\@Late conifer.
    Leaf and wood biomass allometry panels are clipped at 0.2 to facilitate differentiation of posterior distributions.

Model calibration improved the precision of most PFT-specific parameter estimates, including estimates of leaf parameters whose prior distributions were already independently constrained by an earlier analysis (Figure~\ref{fig:posterior-pft}).
Across all PFT-specific parameters, the posterior 95\% credible interval (CI) was, on average, 9\% the size of the prior credible interval.
The most constrained parameters on average were EDR canopy structure parameters---namely the wood biomass allometry (<1\% of prior CI), wood biomass allometry (1\%), specific leaf area (7\%), leaf orientation factor (8\%), and clumping factor (9\%)---
while the least constrained parameters on average were the PROSPECT parameters---namely, effective number of leaf layers (17\%), total carotenoid content (16\%), dry matter content (12\%), total chlorophyll content (12\%), and leaf water content (10\%).
By PFT, the largest relative constraint was for Early Hardwood (5\%) and the smallest relative constraint was for Late Hardwood (14\% of prior CI).

For leaf traits, PFT rankings of the posterior estimates largely followed the relative positions of the priors, though there were a few exceptions.
In both the prior and posterior, the estimated effective number of leaf mesophyll layers (a.k.a., PROSPECT \emph{N} parameter) was higher for needleleaved than broadleaved PFTs, with the highest value for northern pine and the lowest value for mid hardwood.
The exact opposite was true of specific leaf area (SLA), except that late conifer had a lower posterior SLA than northern pine despite a very similar prior.
Estimated total chlorophyll contents (\emph{Cab}) were similarly high for all hardwood PFTs in both the prior and posterior,
but posterior estimates for late conifer and northern pine were significantly lower.
Posterior estimates of total carotenoid contents (\emph{Car}) were similar across all PFTs except mid hardwood, which had a significantly higher value (despite a prior that was similar for all hardwood PFTs).
Posterior estimates of leaf water content (\emph{Cw}) were lowest for early hardwood and northern pine, higher for mid- and late hardwood, and highest for late conifer; these differences were despite strongly overlapping priors across all PFTs.
Similarly, posterior estimates of leaf dry matter content (\emph{Cm}) were lowest for mid- and late hardwood, higher for early hardwood and northern pine, and highest for late conifer, again despite a strongly overlapping prior across all PFTs.

Compared to leaf traits, canopy structural traits had less informative (and PFT-agnostic) priors, and the posterior distributions exhibited some differences across PFTs.
Posterior leaf biomass allometry ($\bbbl$) estimates were lowest in northern pine and early hardwood, higher for late conifer, and highest for mid- and late hardwood.
Posterior wood biomass allometry ($\bbbw$) estimates were lowest for early hardwood and late conifer, slightly higher in mid- and late hardwood, and highest for northern pine.
Posterior canopy clumping factor ($q$) estimates were clustered at its upper limit of 1 (i.e., exhibited ``edge-hitting behavior'') for early and mid hardwood and northern pine, but were lower for late hardwood and lowest for late conifer.
Finally, the calibration was able to constrain site-specific soil optical properties across all sites (Figure~\ref{fig:posterior-soil}).

The accuracy and precision of EDR simulated spectra relative to AVIRIS observations varied across sites (Figures~\ref{fig:spec-error-all}, \ref{fig:spec-error-aggregate}, and~\ref{fig:spec-error-allsites}).
The largest differences between observed and predicted reflectance were in the near-infrared region, particularly from 775 to 1100 \unit{nm},
while predictions in the visible range agreed well with observations in all but a few cases.
That said, the EDR predictive interval overlapped observations in all but a few individual cases (Figure~\ref{fig:spec-error-allsites}), suggesting that our estimates of model uncertainty are realistic.
We did not observe any consistent patterns in mismatch between observed and EDR predicted reflectance with respect to tree size, stem density, or composition (Figures~\ref{fig:bias-boxplot-pft}--\ref{fig:tree-sites-LC}).

\end{figure}

Leaf area index predicted from calibrated EDR parameters captured 43\% of the variability in the observations (Figure~\ref{fig:lai-pred-obs}).
The observed vs.\ predicted line had a slope of 0.37 and an intercept of 2.80, indicating that EDR calibration underpredicted LAI on average but exaggerated across-site LAI variability.

EDR and SAIL differed in their predictions of hemispherical reflectance.
For solar geometry typical of our analysis ($\cos(\theta) = 0.85$), EDR agreed very closely with SAIL directional reflectance over a wide range of LAI values (0.1 to 5),
but SAIL hemispherical reflectance was higher than EDR (Figure TODO).
However, EDR was more sensitive to solar geometry than any of the SAIL reflectance streams:
When the sun was directly overhead ($\theta = 0$; $\cos(\theta) = 1$), EDR predicted lower albedo than even the darkest SAIL bi-directional reflectance, but as solar angle increased, EDR predictions asymptotically approached (but never quite reached) the brightest SAIL bi-hemispherical reflectance.
